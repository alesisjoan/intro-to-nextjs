## Welcome to Next.js Introduction

### Setup

1. Run `yarn install` in the folder in which you cloned the repository. _This is the folder containing the `package.json` file._
2. Run `yarn dev` in the same folder from your terminal. You should get a `ready - started server on http://localhost:3000` message if everything went Ok.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application working.
