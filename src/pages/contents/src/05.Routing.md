### File-system routes

1. `./pages/index.jsx` → `/`
2. `./pages/about.jsx` → `/about`
3. `./pages/about/index.jsx` → `/about`
4. `./pages/about/other/routes/finally.jsx` → `/about/other/routes/finally`

---

### Dynamic routes

Route parameters are received in the `context` object.

1. `./pages/[slug].jsx` → `/:slug`
2. `./pages/shows/[id].jsx` → `/shows/:id`

#### Example

- `./pages/shows/[show]/[episode].jsx` → `/shows/3557/24762`

### Linking dynamic routes

- `href` represents the route structure of the page in the _pages_ directory.
- `as` is the URL that will be used by the browser.
- requires an `a` element or any other element that supports the `onClick()` event.
